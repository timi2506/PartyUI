# PartyUI
**Simple SwiftUI package containing the UI elements we reuse at [jailbreak.party](https://jailbreak.party/).**

## The Idea

We reuse a lot of code between our projects. That's one of the core philosophies of what we do.

> "If you can learn one thing from one project that you can carry with you into everything else you do, that project was a success."
> *Abraham Lincoln*

So, this is PartyUI. It's just a bunch of the UI stuff we reuse thrown together into a nice enough package.

And we're sharing it to the world for free. Lucky you!
